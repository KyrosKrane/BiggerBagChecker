# Bigger Bag Checker Overview
This is a World of Warcraft addon that lets you track your progress for the [Going To Need A Bigger Bag](https://www.wowhead.com/achievement=8728/going-to-need-a-bigger-bag) achievement.

This is an update of Zeatar's addon [Timeless Loot](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/timeless-loot), which he stopped updating in 2014.

When you mouse over a mob or object on Timeless Isle that can drop an item for the [Going To Need A Bigger Bag](https://www.wowhead.com/achievement=8728/going-to-need-a-bigger-bag) achievement, the tooltip will display a few extra lines indicating the item, whether you need it, and an estimated drop chance.

This addon has no configuration or setup. Just install it and go!

Feedback and suggestions are welcome!

## Localization
Bigger Bag Checker is localized for enUS, ruRU, frFR, deDE, zhTW, and zhCN.

If you're able to help localize this in other languages, please [visit my Discord server](https://discord.gg/YRBDrxQ) and let me know!

## Updates
This version fixes the required drops (which is mostly what broke in the original version when Warlords of Draenor was released), and it updates the code to work a bit more cleanly. The display is now also clearer about which drops are needed and which are done. It also has a new zhCN translation.

## Known errors
None!

## Future update plans
Let me know what you'd like to see in the comments section. Or for live support, [visit my Discord server](https://discord.gg/YRBDrxQ)! (Assuming I'm awake and online, of course!)
